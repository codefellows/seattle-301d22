- Lab Prep
	- Let's see it in action!
	- Study the starter code! Especially **articleView.js**!
	- Here's some things you *might could maybe* need today... you should look at the docs in the [jQuery Cheat sheet](http://oscarotero.com/jquery/) to see how they work:
		- .animate() [with some **scrollTop** action!]
		- .append()
		- .attr()
		- .click()
		- .data()
		- .each()
		- .fadeIn()
		- .find()
		- .hide()
		- .html()
		- .not()
		- .on()
		- .parent()
		- .text()
		- .val() -->

## Learning Objectives
<!--
ABCD:
  Audience: Program participants
  Behavior: Expected learning/behavior changes/results
  Condition:
    Circumstances that lead to change/result
    When change/result are expected to occur
  Degree: How much change occurs (%) for how many participants (#)
-->

* Execute event bindings with jQuery’s `$.on()` method

- Deter students from using the event method and to instead bind the event using `$.on()`

* Comprehend when event delegation is appropriate.

* Be able to configure event bindings using delegation.

* Familiarity with `data-`attributes & concatenation.
