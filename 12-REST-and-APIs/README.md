=======
## Overview
<!-- Provide a general overview of the daily concepts and processes that will be covered in lectures and labs -->

*The focus of this day is on solidifying the underlying concepts of the REST architectural style and how to interact with application resources through the use of the HTTP verbs, jQuery AJAX methods, and keys or tokens as needed, to make GET requests to external public APIs.*

## Daily Plan

<!-- - Project Week is coming! There is a Canvas assignment to discuss project ideas; we will do so as a group at the beginning of class tomorrow.

-  Friday we'll get Project Week underway! Teams will be able to pick whatever project they want from a list of approved ideas, or propose a new one.

- Let's look at a few recent final 301 projects from before your 201!
	- [Price I$ Right Parking](http://priceisrightparking.herokuapp.com/)
	- [Barkrawl](https://barkrawl.herokuapp.com/)
	- [Fremont Patroller](https://fremont-bike-patroller.herokuapp.com/)
	- [DroneStrike](https://whendronesattack.herokuapp.com/)
	- [Moviefinder](https://movfinder.herokuapp.com/)
	- [Crime City](http://crime-city.herokuapp.com/)
	- [Find My BikeTown](https://find-my-biketown.herokuapp.com/)

- Reminder: the entrance exam for the 401 courses (which doubles as the final exam for this course, and is part of the grade for this course, so you should take it even if not immediately going into a 401) will be published on Friday afternoon and be available until 11:59pm Sunday.

- There is also Quiz 3 to complete over the weekend, PLUS a bonus ***ungraded*** quiz 3.14 to help you prep for the 401 exam.

- 	If you'd like to schedule a one-on-one meeting with Sam over the next week, please select one of the slots available at [this link](https://sam-301d20.youcanbook.me/).

- Depending on time, we'll try to do some code review before a break

`BREAK (10 minutes)`

**Slides: RESTful endpoints and External APIs**

- "How I explained REST to my brother..."
- REST concepts
- RESTful routes
- App state and transition

**APIs**

- What
- Why
- How

[Postman](https://www.getpostman.com) is nice tool for inspecting API responses, such as from `http://swapi.co/api/people/4`. Try entering that into a browser, and then selecting the JSON option from the dropdown at the right. Is it hard to read? Then add JSONView to Chrome!

**Demo with the GitHub API**

- Clone [this repo](https://github.com/codefellows/code-301-github-api) that we'll use for building out an example

`BREAK (10 minutes)`

*(Continue/finish demo depending on time)*

**Review of the starter code for lab**

- Look at the README
- Look at the TODOs

**Other topics on REST as time permits**

- [Wikipedia: REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)
- [Who the heck is Roy Fielding?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Fielding)
- [Make that Dr. Roy Fielding, whose doctoral dissertation initially defined REST](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm)
- [SOAP vs REST](http://blog.smartbear.com/apis/understanding-soap-and-rest-basics/) -->

## Learning Objectives
<!--
ABCD:
  Audience: Program participants
  Behavior: Expected learning/behavior changes/results
  Condition:
    Circumstances that lead to change/result
    When change/result are expected to occur
  Degree: How much change occurs (%) for how many participants (#)
-->

* Understand the history of HTTP, and the central role that REST plays.
* Use RESTful routes for a web service, to retrieve their own github repos
* Design RESTful endpoints for their own blogging app
