=======
## Overview
<!-- Provide a general overview of the daily concepts and processes that will be covered in lectures and labs -->

*The focus of this day is on solidifying the underlying concepts of the REST architectural style and how to interact with application resources through the use of the HTTP verbs, jQuery AJAX methods, and keys or tokens as needed, to make GET requests to external public APIs.*

## Daily Plan

## Learning Objectives
<!--
ABCD:
  Audience: Program participants
  Behavior: Expected learning/behavior changes/results
  Condition:
    Circumstances that lead to change/result
    When change/result are expected to occur
  Degree: How much change occurs (%) for how many participants (#)
-->

* Understand the history of HTTP, and the central role that REST plays.
* Use RESTful routes for a web service, to retrieve their own github repos
* Design RESTful endpoints for their own blogging app
